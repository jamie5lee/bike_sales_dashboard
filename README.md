# Bike Sales Dashboard
In this project, I undertook an analysis of bike sales data. I started by cleaning the raw data of the bike sales data, transforming it into clean data which I then used to generate insightful visualizations. 

I used pivot tables to transform the data into the following graphs: Bikes Purchased and Average Income by Gender, Bikes Purchased by Age Bracket, and Commute Distance and Bike Purchase Trends.

After creating the pivot tables I took the visualizations a step further, and created an interactive visualization.

As shown in the image, this dashboard is interactive, and can be sorted by multiple different factors, including marital status, education, and lastly region.
